License activation

Some Modelio editions are provided with a 10-day trial period. During this period, the application is fully functional. After this period, Modelio activation is required in order to set up the purchased license rights.

What is activation?

Activation consists of applying license rights to the Modelio product and/or its modules (extensions). In this way, it helps prevent software piracy and illegal distribution.

Activating the license

First of all, you must purchase Modelio and/or its modules online or by contacting our sales department. After purchasing a Modelio edition or module(s), one or more activation codes, depending on your order, are sent by email. You must keep these activation codes, as they may be required if you contact us.

There are two kinds of license, node-locked and floating. A node-locked license is a single license model. It allows a user to use our product on one machine. A floating license allows our product to be run on multiple machines up to the limit specified in the license file. A license server is required to distribute licenses to client machines.

Node-Locked license

You can activate a node-locked license in two ways: automatically over the Internet or manually if you don't have Internet access.

Floating license

Before launching Modelio on any machine, you need to configure a license server.
